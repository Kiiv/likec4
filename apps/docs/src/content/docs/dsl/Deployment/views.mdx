Deployment views allow you to visualize the deployment model, using same approach as [model views](/dsl/views) â€” predicates.

## View definition

```likec4 {17-23}
deployment {
  environment prod {
    zone eu {
      zone zone1 {
        instanceOf frontend.ui
        instanceOf backend.api
      }
      zone zone2 {
        instanceOf frontend.ui
        instanceOf backend.api
      }
      instanceOf database
    }    
  }
}
views {
  deployment view index {
    title 'Production Deployment'
    link https://likec4.dev

    include prod.**
    // ...
  }
}
```

## View predicates

Deployment views use same [predicates](/dsl/views/#view-predicates) as model views, but refer to deployment nodes or instances.
